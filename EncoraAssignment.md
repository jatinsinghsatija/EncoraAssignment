Practical Test

Below are the instructions for completing the test. Please read them carefully and ensure all
requirements are met:
Task Description:
1. API Integration:
   • Open the provided API URL (Click Here) in a web browser to understand its structure
   and data format.
2. Native Application Development:
   • Implement a native Android using Kotlin application that integrates with the above
   API.
3. Data Handling:
   • Fetch and store the top 20 songs from the API into a local Room database.
   • Ensure the API is called only once when the application runs for the first time.
   Subsequent launches should retrieve data from the local database.

4. User Interface:
   • Display the top 20 songs in a RecyclerView, populated from the Room database.
   • Each cell/record in the RecyclerView should display the album image and title of the
   song.

5. Navigation and Detail Screen:
   • Implement functionality so that clicking on a cell in the RecyclerView navigates to a
   detail screen.
   • The detail screen should show all details of the selected song, including the ability to
   play the song.

Additional Requirements:
• Architecture: Use a modern and appropriate architecture pattern suitable for Android
development.
• Data Format: Use XML format for data parsing (not JSON).
• Offline Database: Utilize Room Database for local data storage.
• Compatibility: Ensure the application supports Android versions 7 (Nougat) to the latest.

Submission Details:
• Please share your completed practical via a private repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) or a
Google Drive link.
• Include all necessary project files, such as source code and any additional documentation or
instructions.

Evaluation Criteria:
Your practical test will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
1. Technical Implementation:
   • Accuracy and completeness of the implementation according to the given
   instructions.
   • Adherence to modern Android architecture principles and best practices.
   • Proper handling of API integration and data persistence using Room Database.
2. User Interface and User Experience (UI/UX):
   • Design and layout of the RecyclerView and detail screen.
   • Usability and intuitive navigation within the application.
3. Code Quality:
   • Cleanliness and organization of code.
   • Effective use of XML for data parsing and XML resources.
4. Performance:
   • Efficiency of data fetching and rendering.
   • Responsiveness of the application during navigation and data retrieval.
5. Time Management:
   • The time taken to complete the practical test will also be considered. Candidates
   should aim to demonstrate efficient use of time while maintaining high-quality
   implementation.

Deadline:
• The practical test should be completed and submitted as soon as possible.
